[![Hestia Libraries](src/icons/animated-banner_1200x200.svg)](#)

Dependency hell, constant updates, security nightmares, and geopolitical
instability got you down? Don't let them derail your projects. Hestia offers
a powerful solution: an unified, robust software library suite for seamless
front-end and back-end development. With a focus on consistency,
decentralization supply chain, and simplicity, Hestia empowers developers to
build stable, secure applications across all platforms, from embedded systems
to the cloud, with peace in mind.

***Hestia - Develop with Confidence***

This specific library facilitates the kernel functions of all other Hestia
libraries. It has zero-dependency and is self-contained.




## Why It Matters

This project was initiated primarily because of:

1. **Ensures proper interoperability between programming languages** -
   making sure the all libraries talk to each other seamlessly across multiple
   programming languages with the same context.
2. **Maximizing test across from all supporting technologies** - same algorithm
   and battle tested by many specialized tools from various language-specific
   technologies.
3. **Maximizing algorithm benefits** - one algorithm with high frequencies of
   improvements.
4. **Decentralized supply chain** - be completely done with idiotic geo-politic
   nuisances.
5. **Simple to integrate** - seamless integration for all supported programming
   languages.
